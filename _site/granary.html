	<p class="text-muted">We are bringing Worcester’s historic granary store back into community use. Restoration work began in 2020 after a long process of purchasing and developing plans.  
	This beautiful four storey city centre building was originally part of the Hill and Evans vinegar works, constructed about 1830.
	As well being functioning as a church hub on Sundays, The Granary will be used to Build Community, Help the Vulnerable and Enrich Culture in our wonderful city.
	For photographs of the building works, and up to date information, feel free to look at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/worcestergranary/">The Granary, Worcester Facebook page.</a>
	To date, the structure has been made safe, the outer shell totally restored and the ground floor made usable.
	The next phases, for which we are seeking funding, will include installing a lift, kitchen, disabled toilets on each floor, 2nd fix electrics and heating on upper floors…
	If you would like to contribute to this lasting legacy, click below to donate.</p>
